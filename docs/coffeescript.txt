Running / compiling the app

You need to install CoffeeScript first (via Node Package Manager, which means that you also need to install Node.js first).

While developing, you can run the following command inside the src/ folder:

coffee --bare --lint -o js/ -cw coffee/

--bare: removes the function safety wrapper
--lint: uses jslint (you need to install jslint separately)
-o: output in the js/ folder
-c: compile
-w watch the coffee/ folder
