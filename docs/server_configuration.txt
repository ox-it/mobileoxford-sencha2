In order to use offline cache, .manifest files need to be served with a special mime type.

Add the following line to your Apache configuration file:

AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest

Dear developer, in order to be able to debug offline caching issues correctly, you should enable the "expires" module and set on your vhost conf file:

Header set Expires "Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GM"
Header set Cache-Control "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"
Header set Pragma "no-cache"
Header unset ETag
FileETag None

Sencha Touch library is hosted outside the application, you can use the following directive in your vhost configuration:

    Alias /sencha-touch /home/martin/Projects/sencha-touch

Remove the js/ folder level:

    Alias /app /home/molly/Projects/mobileoxford-sencha2/src/js/app
